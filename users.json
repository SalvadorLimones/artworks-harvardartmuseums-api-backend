Directly across it is a large cathedral with a row of tall arches on the front facade, a roof with multiple domes topped with crosses, and at right, a spire that rises several times taller than all buildings around it. The spire rises to a platform surrounded by columns which are topped with a tall, sharply angled roof on which a winged statue stands. Under a fair, blue sky, the scene is lit by bright sunshine, the building at right casting a short shadow onto the piazza.",
