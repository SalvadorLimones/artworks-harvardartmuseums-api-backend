A terra-cotta colored boat right of center faces us, reflecting its color into the water. Green land situated on the left includes a dock, and a house with terra-cotta roof partially obscured by three thin tall trees, also reflecting into the water. A few white puffy clouds drift by on the right, a shear blue-grey mist hovers over the horizon dotted by green trees in the distance. Five white water birds float on the left close to shore.",
